Vital Records Management System Using Python
The Vital Records Management System project aims to provide a software solution for managing and organizing vital records of patients. It is designed to be used in a healthcare or medical setting, where the accurate and efficient management of patient data is crucial.

The project consists of two main components: a login system and a dashboard for managing patient vital records. The login system ensures that only authorized personnel can access the system, providing an additional layer of security to protect patient information.

Once logged in, the user is presented with the dashboard, which serves as the main interface for interacting with the vital records. The dashboard provides functionalities such as viewing, searching, adding, and deleting patient records. The patient records contain important information such as name, age, sex, address, contact number, email, blood group, weight, and height.

The dashboard also allows users to export patient vital signs data in PDF or CSV format. This feature enables healthcare professionals to generate reports and share vital information with other medical staff or patients.

The project incorporates a user-friendly graphical interface using the Tkinter library in Python. It utilizes a MySQL database to store and retrieve patient information, ensuring data integrity and scalability.

Overall, the Vital Records Management System project aims to streamline the process of managing patient vital records, improve data accessibility, and enhance the efficiency of healthcare facilities.
